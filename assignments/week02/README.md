# Assignment 2: Card Draw

I was assigned to create a script that used an API to draw a hand of 5 cards and display them.

As a further challenge we could modify the script to check if the user has drawn a pair, triple, straight, or all of the same suit and congratulate the user.

The code uses a combination of dictionaries, sets and lists to detect all special poker hands, delcare the special hand and congratulate the user. 

This script can be run in codespaces or downloaded and run with python.
